# Ex0tic_Bot
Ex0tic_Bot is a multipurpose bot written in Python that I made because I was bored.

So one day, I got bored and stuff so I decided to make a bot. I made this repos to keep track of everything, share it with others, and also for educational purposes which is kind of a bad idea because my programming skills aren't actually good.
But anyways, I wanted to say something:
### **PLEASE Don't copy this code and pass it off as your own**
I ask this of you, the reader, because it would cost you the experience of making a bot and learning the API. While I can't stop you, and I don't think a license would either, I trust the you will understand why I wouldn't want you to copy it and will respect my request.

Anyways, as for the bot, I would like it to server a variety of purposes, from Moderation, to a Currency System, I want the bot to be a perfect addition to any server with a range of different purposes.  
While some may like its Moderation aspect, others may prefer its fun commands and not use the Moderation aspect of the bot all together, which is intended. The bot is made to suite the needs of servers with flexibility in mind. 
My bot will most likely not bring anything new to the table as I'm focusing on making it simple to use and versatile.  
But this doesn't mean there is no room for new features.  
Because I'm on vacation till the 26th, I will most likely not touch this repo until I get back because programming on this computer sucks :(
